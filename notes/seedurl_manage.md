- [ ] url management based on Streaming computing framework
Actuall, this part I assume I already get the url by spider. what I need to understand is three part:
1. how to start the flink and set flink evrionment
   ``` StreamExecutionEnvironment env =
       StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();
        env.setParallelism(4); 
3. figure out the level of url:the way of judgement.
   firstly,get the whole html by httputil.
5. sinkfunction: how to store the url
6. how to get the new url from flink.
