Today my first goal is write a class to replace the redis. it's too hard learning redis in such less time. so I want to just finished the part of FLink.  
goal:  
- [ ] let flink part run successfully. 

steps:
1. figure out what kind of dataset flink need?
2. change my class'code to fit that requirement
